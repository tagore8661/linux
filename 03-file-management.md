cat file.txt
less file.txt
head file.txt
tail file.txt
```

## 3. Copy Files and Directories
Copy a file:
```bash
cp file.txt backup.txt
```
Copy a directory:
```bash
cp -r dir1/ dir2/
```

## 4. Move/Rename Files

```
Rename a file:

```
Delete a directory:

```

## 6. List Files
List files in a directory:
